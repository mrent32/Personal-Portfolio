                <p>My name is Martin Renteria, I am currently a restaurant General Manager.
                        I have mostly background in the service industry, especially at restaurants, 
                        although I have also done some security work. I am currently enrolled in 
                        a coding bootcamp to learn the skill of full stack web development. 
                        My current goals are to fully transfer industries within the next year. 
                        I have experience in HTML and CSS, as this page here shows. We are in the 
                        process of learning Javascript right now in school to complete the 
                        back end side of web development. Listed here on this page is examples 
                        of work I have completed, a link to a deployed application I have worked on
                        and various ways to get in contact with me.
